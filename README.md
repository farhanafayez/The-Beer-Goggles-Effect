# The-Beer-Goggles-Effect
Two Way Independent ANOVA

A two way independent is used when two independent variables have been manipulated using different participants inn all conditions.

In this repo, we are trying to find out effects of alcohol on mate selection during a night out. It is assumed that the percepion of attractiveness becomes not so accurate after few drinking sessions.

We can see that with placebo drink, both males and females choose a high percentage of attractive mate.
